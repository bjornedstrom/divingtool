divingtool
==========

This program is a homeage to the wednesday of november 17:th 2010 when
I become a diving functionary by mistake.

Sample usage. Calculate points:

`$ ./divingtool -c 1.9=5,5,5,6,7.5`

This will print 30.4.

Print a diving code in human readable form:

`$ ./divingtool --decode 6243A`

This will print "armstand back double somersault 1Â½ twists (straight)".
